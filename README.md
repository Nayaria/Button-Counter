This is a simple web-app that can be used to count how many tinmes a certain button has been pressed.
It can be usefull for selling things at a yard sale easily, going through inventory etc.

The project is not yet finished as I dont have a server I can run it on and I ran out of time creating the project, but I may finish it in the holidays.
For now, please view the project via a localhost because JavaScript won't work if you just open the file. I also recommend a good resolution monitor (4k at least) because it's optimised for a 4k monitor.
A detailed instruction on how to use this can be found on the site soon.
